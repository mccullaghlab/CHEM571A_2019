This function, called the wavefunction, has the important property that $\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)dxdydz$ is the probability that the particle lies in the volume element $dxdydz$ located at $\\mathbf{r}$ at time $t$."

In this case we write $\\mathbf{r} = (\\mathbf{r_1},\\mathbf{r_1},...,\\mathbf{r_N}) = ((x_1,y_1,z_1),(x_2,y_2,z_2),...,(x_N,y_N,z_N))$ for an $N$ particle system.  Note this also mean that we must integrate over each $x_i$, $y_i$ and $z_i$.  We abbreviate this by writing $d\\tau$ to denote integration over all degrees of freedom of all particles.  So for an $N$ particle system we can write that $\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)d\\tau$ denotes the probability of finding the $N$ particles in the hyper volume element $d\\tau$ located at $\\mathbf{r}$ at time t."
