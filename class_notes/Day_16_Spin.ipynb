    "Despite the success of quantum theory in the early 1900s, there were still a few experiments that it could not adequately describe. The most well known example is the measurement of atomic spectrum of sodium.  There is a doublet splitting in yellow line of this spectrum that cannot be explained by the spatial and energetic quantum theories presented thus far.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1925, two physcists, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit, demonstrated that by assigning spin to an electron they could achieve the splitting seen in the experimental spectrum.  This amounts to the introduction of a spin quantum numer, $m_s$, for each electron that can take on values of $\\pm 1/2$.  "
