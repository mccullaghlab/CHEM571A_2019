    "1. Determine the optimal coefficients for fitting the \"data\" given below to basis functions $g_0(x) = 1 $, $g_1(x) = x $, $g_2(x) = (x-3)^2$, $g_3(x) = (x-3)^3 $, $g_4(x) = e^{x}$.  Provide a plot with data and fit as well as numerical values of the coefficients.  The trial/variational wave function should look like $\\phi = \\sum_{i=0}^4c_ig_i(x)$.\n",

    "2. Determine the energy and wavefunction of the first excited state of the particle in a 1D box bounded by $0\\leq x \\leq a$ using the variational principle and a fourth order polynomial expansion of the wavefunction (i.e. $\\psi(x) \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^4c_nx^n$).   Compare the energy to that of the analytic solution.\n",

    "3. The potential for a quantum harmonic oscillator is given as $V(x) = 1/2kx^2$. Make a plot that depicts the potential and at least the first five energy levels for two oscialltors, one with $k=1.0$ and the other with $k=3.0$.  \n",

    "4. Derive expressions (perform the integrals) for the variational matrix elements ($H_{ij}$ and $S_{ij}$) third and fourth order terms of the Taylor series expansion of the Morse potential (around the minimum) in a gaussian basis.  Gaussian basis functions are given as $g_i(x) = e^{-\\alpha (x-x_i)^2}$."
